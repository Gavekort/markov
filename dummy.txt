This is awesome, but I am wondering what is so interesting about this scene that compelled you both to take the same shot ha.
My Dad and I discussed this.
I was driving through and thought the water on the road, the store signs/lights, and the fog drifting in all made for a decent pic.
Dad says he just liked the way the cars were lined up.
In fairness, we both take tons of pictures of almost anything.
Those 70s cars look so uniform compared to the modern pic.
And they're all freakin boats too
